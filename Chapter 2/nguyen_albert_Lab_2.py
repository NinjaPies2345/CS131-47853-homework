Soft drinks are sold in cans and bottles. A store offers a six-pack of
12-ounce cans for the same price as a two-liter bottle. Which should
you buy? (1 liter is 33.814 ounces)

You will need the following variables:
List of variables                                    Type of Number
Number of cans per pack                         Whole number
Ounces per can                                        Whole number
Ounces per bottle                                     Number with fraction

Write a program that calculates the capacity of soda in a six-pack of soda and print it.

Print a statement at the end that states which is the better buy. Your program should demonstrate the use of variables and constants.

Given two integers, write a program that prints
The sum
The difference
The product
The average
The distance (absolute value of the difference)
The maximum (the larger of the two)
The minimum (the smaller of the two)
Hint: Python defines max and min functions that accept a sequence of values, each
separated with a comma.
